foxcatcher
Displays a warning whenever a player hits another player through the fog.
In other words, everytime a player hits a player which is 128+ (horizontal)
blocks away. This is referred to as a fogshot.
At 128 horizontal blocks, players are completely covered by the fog (At least in OS),
so hitting players farther than that is considered to be cheating, thus a
warning is issued to admins. Each time said player lands a hit on a player
which is 128 horizontal blocks away, an incident counter also increases.
This is useful for telling apart false-positives and lucky players
getting a lucky one-time fogshot. Once the incident counter reaches
a certain set amount (MINIMUM_INCIDENTS_TO_BROADCAST), the next incidents
will be broadcasted to the whole server. This is useful in case the server
staff is not available or if there's no one checking IRC chat, thus
players in the server can issue a votekick against the cheating player.

The fog is assumed to be completely opaque at 128. The only visibility
a player has can be described with a cylinder of infinite height, starting
from the bottom of the world all the way to the "sky". The player is at the
center of this cylinder. This cylinder has a radius of 128. Outside this cylinder
everything is obscured by the fog, so other players out of this cylinder shouldn't
be visible to the player in question, under normal conditions that is. Everything
that the player hits outside this cylinder is considered to be a fogshot and is
reported.

Another way to see this is by imagining the game map from a top down perspective.
A player's (absolute) visibility can be described with a circle that has a radius of
128 blocks, with the player being in the center of this circle. Every hit outside
this circle is thus considered to be a fogshot.

Fogshot determination only takes into account horizontal distance to the target,
since the fog isn't affected by height. The vertical distance is only used to
calculate pitch to the target, which is included in the warnings. The pitch itself
isn't useful, however, it provides us with extra info about the conditions which the
fogshot happened.

Changelog:

    1.1.1:
        * Autobanning is now on by default.

    1.1.0:
        * Renamed script (fogshot_warn -> foxcatcher).
        * Autoban feature added. Enable it by doing "/toggle_foxcatcher_autoban" as an admin.
